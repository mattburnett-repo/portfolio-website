This website serves as my personal portfolio, built with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS/SASS to showcase my
skills and
projects. As an exercise in basic web development, it demonstrates my capability to create a functional
and visually
appealing site without relying on external libraries or technologies.

The site is designed to be SEO optimized, ensuring that search engines can effectively index and rank
its
content. It incorporates structured data in conformance with schema.org standards, enhancing the
websiteâ€™s visibility
and relevance in search results. This attention to SEO and structured data underscores my commitment to
best practices
in web development.

By focusing on core technologies and optimization techniques, this project highlights my proficiency in
crafting a
professional, responsive, and search-engine-friendly online presence. It serves as a testament to my
ability to build a
fully functional portfolio site that adheres to modern web standards while maintaining a clean and
effective design.
